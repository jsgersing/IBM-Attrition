### IBM Attrition

For this notebook, I use the IMB Attrition dataset (available on Kaggle) to do the following:
* Compare the predictive performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models using Confusions Matrices and ROC Curves 
* Explore relative feature importance with respect to employee attrition for the XGBoost model using Gini Importances and Permutation_Importance
* Further explore feature importance through visualization tools PDP Plots, PDP Interaction Plots, and Shapley Waterfall Plots
